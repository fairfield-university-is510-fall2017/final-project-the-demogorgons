The Demogorgons

Video Games

**Motivations**

The dataset we found using Kaggle was massive, being a register of the global video games sales with over 16,000 rows.  We knew we had to pare down the data as much as possible while still retaining critical data values.  It was interesting seeing the different sales trends when comparing them to the different attributes of a video game.  

**Data Source**

The dataset is provided by Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales).  

**Challenges**

We ran into a few obstacles throughout our project and exaplin them below.
1. Importing and inserting the data was a roadblock but once we overcame it the rest of the project was manageable.  
2. Translating the ERD into a functioning database.

**Lessons Learned**

How to put together a database in a completely new program.  SQLite was quick and easy to learn for the project, but we would have to remind ourselves we were not working in MySQL.  The coding is different compared to SQLite.
