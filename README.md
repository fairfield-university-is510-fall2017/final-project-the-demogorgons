# The Demogorgons

## Video Games

### **Motivations**

The dataset we found on Kaggle was a historice record of global database of video games sales broken down to regions of North America, Europe, Japan, and others.  We knew we had to pare it down as much as possible while still retaining critical values for data definition, manipulation, and analysis. Amongst the team members, the knowledge of video games ranged from none whatsoever to well-versed.  This range of familiarity let us help each other understand the data values and the importance of all information.  It also allowed us all to learn about databases and related processes in SQLites and Python. 

This project was difficult at certain points, but these obstacles are the area we learned the most from.  The tasks in which we had to apply our knowledge of Python, Pandas, MySql, and Sqlite proved to be the most complex, but also the best test of our understanding and critical thinking.  We were surprised at our level of patience and focus even when we would hit a roadblock and need to forumalate new ideas.

### **Challenges**

Challenges?  There were many.  
We experienced our fair share of obstacles throughout the project.  They are explained below.  
1. Importing and inserting the data was a tough roadblock.  We were stuck on it for a while and had to go back a few different times.  But once we overcame it with the help of Dr. Huntley, the rest of the project was manageable so long we stayed focused.  
2. Finalizing the ERD so that all logical and necessary attributes, relationships, and tables were featured. We would have to revise it a few times because we had to see it in a few different perspectives throughout the project.    
3. Translating the ERD into a functioning database. Making sure it all comes together!
4. Finding and fixing bugs from different type of errors.  

### **Lessons Learned**

We may have experienced significant challenges, we were able to overcome them and learn a great deal from the struggles.  Lessons learned are explained below.  
1. How to put together a database in a completely new program.  SQLite was quick and easy to learn for the project, but we would have to remind ourselves we were not working in MySQL as we were for the entirety of the semester.  We had to familiarize ourselves with the new coding format.
2. When a certain way proves unsuccessful, do not spend much more time agonizing over it.  Take your time, figure out the issue carefully, and if not, attempt it a different way.  
3. Use all the resources available.  RTM!  Self-explanatory. 
4. Dr. Huntley helped us through many of our roadblocks and his help is greatly appreciated.
