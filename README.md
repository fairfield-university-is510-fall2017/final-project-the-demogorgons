## Video Games

### **Motivations**

The dataset we found on Kaggle was a register of the global video games sales totling over 16,000 rows of data.  We knew we had to pare it down as much as possible while still retaining the critical data values. Amongst the team members, the knowledge of video games ranged from none whatsoever to well-versed.  This diverse set let us help each other understand the data values and its importance to the remainder of the information.  
This project was difficult at certain points, but it was the obstacles that we all learned the most from.  The tasks in which we had to apply our knowledge of Python, Pandas, MySql, and Sqlite proved to be the most complex, but also the most integrative.  

### **Data Source**

The dataset is provided by Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales).  

### **Challenges**

We ran into our fair share of obstacles throughout our project.  Our challenges are explained below.  
1. Importing and inserting the data was a roadblock but once we overcame it the rest of the project was manageable.  
2. Finalizing the ERD so that all logical and necessary attributes, relationships, and tables were featured.   
3. Translating the ERD into a functioning database.

### **Lessons Learned**

We may have experienced significant challenges, we were able to overcome them and learn a great deal from the struggles.  Lessons learned are explained below.  
1. How to put together a database in a completely new program.  SQLite was quick and easy to learn for the project, but we would have to remind ourselves we were not working in MySQL as we were for the entirety of the semester.  We had to familiarize ourselves with the new coding format.
2. When a certain way proves unsuccessful, do not spend much more time agonizing over it.  Take your time, figure out the issue carefully, and if not, attempt a different way.  
3. Use all the resources available.  Self-explanatory.
